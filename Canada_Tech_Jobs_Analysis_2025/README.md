# 📊 Canada Tech Jobs Dashboard (2025) – Power BI Mini Project

Hey there! 👋  
This project is a hands-on Power BI dashboard I built to explore tech job trends across Canada using a sample dataset of real job postings.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To uncover insights from job posting data, such as:

- 🌟 Which **tech skills** are in highest demand?
- 🏙️ Which **cities** are hiring the most?
- 📅 When are jobs being posted?
- 🔗 What skill combinations appear together in job descriptions?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** – Interactive data visuals and dashboard building  
- **Python (Jupyter)** – For early visual exploration using pandas, seaborn  
- **CSV Dataset** – Contains job title, skills, location, and posted date

---

## 📈 Visuals Included

- 📌 **Bar Chart** – Top 5 in-demand skills  
- 🥧 **Pie Chart** – Job distribution by city  
- 📉 **Line Chart** – Jobs posted over time  
- 🌡️ **Heatmap** – Skill co-occurrence (who’s often paired with whom)  
- 📦 **Box Plot** – Skill count per job posting  
- 🎛️ **Slicer** – Filter dashboard by location

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🐍 **Python**, **SQL**, and **JavaScript** are leading the pack  
- ☁️ **AWS** and container tools like **Docker** are hot in DevOps roles  
- 🏙️ **Toronto** is the top city for tech hiring
